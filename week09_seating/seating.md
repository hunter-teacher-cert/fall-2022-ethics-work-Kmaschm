# Seating Algorithm
## Katherine (Kate) Maschmeyer

### Algorithm
Allocate priority seating (for those who in need, assume those making reservation indicate need accurately and truthfully 100% of the time)

If party making reservation qualifies for priority seating, show all options for seats with priority highlighted - party will choose priority or priority & other seats to keep party together

If party does not quality for priority seating, show only open non-priority seats.  Party chooses first (front to back, left to right) set of seats next to already reserved priority seating.  If no priority seating is reserved, choose non-priority seating at random. 

### Ideas:
* Like concert tickets: let people choose seats for all in their party
* Seat passengers starting from front to back, left to right, parties together 
* Priority seating: keep seats blocked off for priority needs (like on buses or subways) until reserved by someone in need - will need to deal with keeping booking parties together
* Set aside a couple rows of seating for parties of 3+: parties of 1 or 2 can't book these
* Different priority seating or reserved rows for different types of flights
