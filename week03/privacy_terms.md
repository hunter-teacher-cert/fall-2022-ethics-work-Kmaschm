## by Katherine (Kate) Maschmeyer

## Services and Policies
* Desmos: https://www.desmos.com/privacy
* DeltaMath: https://www.deltamath.com/privacy-policy/, https://www.desmos.com/studentdata


## Data Collected
Note: both services rely on each school to provide appropriate notice to parents of the school's use of third party service providers such as their service, and for the schools to provide consent, if necessary, and authorization for the service to collect Student Data, as permitted by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

**Desmos**
* <ins>From teachers:</ins>
  * 
* <ins>From students:</ins>
  * first and last name
  * email address
  * class assignment data and other classroom content
  * invitation code
  *  To save content on the Service, the Student will need to register for a Desmos account by providing some personal information or by logging in through a Google account.

  * school name and address where they currently teach
  * full name and salutation
  * email address and password
  * information about the classes they are teaching (name/section)
  * Usage data: web request, Internet Protocol address, operating system, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform type, click history, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and whether you opened an email
  * Third party analytics and bug tracking software (including, without limitation, Google Analytics) 
  
* <ins>From students:</ins>
  *  full name
  *  email address and password
  *  correct class section
  *  teacher code (must be shared by teacher)
  *  which problems where attempted
  *  the time at which each problem was attempted
  *  the answers the student submitted and whether they were correct
  *  the duration the student was working on each problem
  *  whether each assignment was completed on time
  *  the completion percentage for each assignment
  *  If the problems have corresponding videos:
      *  whether the student watched the videos and for how long.
  * If the teacher decides to assign a "Test Correction" assignment:
      *  their grade on the given test or quiz
      *  which questions they got wrong
  *  Usage data: web request, Internet Protocol address, operating system, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform type, click history, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and whether you opened an email
  * IP addresses for any given problem solved in order to ensure that multiple accounts are not signing in from the same computer possibly indicating one student is signing into another student's account to complete work under a false identity
    

## How data is used:
**DeltaMath**
 * To help ensure students have the correct class: teacher name & salutation, school name, school address
 * To protect student data that teachers have access to: teacher email & password 
 * To send infrequent updates about DeltaMath: teacher email address
 * To create assignments on a per class/section basis: information about the classes teachers are teaching (name/section)
 * To ensure unique login as well as password recovery initiated by the student: student email & password
 * To track student progress:
     * which problems where attempted
     * the time at which each problem was attempted
     * the answers the student submitted and whether they were correct
     * the duration the student was working on each problem
     * whether each assignment was completed on time
     * the completion percentage for each assignment
 * To combat cheating (a student completing another student's work under a false identity):  IP addresses for any given problem solved
 * Addtionally, DeltaMath states that they share information to: 
    * Develop new products and features
    * Respond to requests for information or customer support
    * Customize the service
    * Send teachers information about new features and DeltaMath products 

## How assignments/activities are shared:
**Desmos**

**DeltaMath**
* Teachers have the opportunity to share their assignments with all DeltaMath users, but the default is that all assignments created are private. 



## Notes: 
* Neither service allows 3rd party targeted advertising.

* In DeltaMath: teachers can turn off the requirement for student email addresses to be used during registration. If used, the teacher can assign non-personally identifiable usernames and nicknames in order to increase student anonymity. The only users that will be able to see the student personally identifiable information are the teachers for whom the student has registered.

* In DeltaMath: Teachers are not able to see their students' passwords, but the teacher is able to reset the password of a student in the event that a student has forgotten their password.

* Desmos provides a short summary for each section of their privacy policy before going into further detail.  Desmos also has a separate student data privacy statement.

* DeltaMath's privacy policy is first focused on how they collect and use information. This section also describes what information they collect. I wonder if this is done to reduce people's focus on what is collected:    For students: full name, email address, password, correct class section, and teacher code, which will link school name and school address.  
 





First look over the references on this page:
https://aboutmyinfo.org/identity/about
Next, select two services: They could be domain-specific (like an education platform); generic (say, Gmail); or could even be two competitors (like two email providers).
Read their privacy policies.
Post the products you are reviewing and comment on one thing for each policy (what it is, why it's good or bad or what raises flags, in your opinion).
If someone posts re: your chosen product before you do, comment on their thread rather than creating a new one.
TASK: Write up a short summary comparing and contrasting. Include an overview of what data is collected and maintained and how they may or may not use it.
If another class member is working on the same two products you can work with them on the writeup. Make sure to include both names and make sure the file is uploaded to both of your repos.
