## HS matching algorithm
Need:
* For each school: Name, current match, & ranking of studemts
* For each student: Name, current match, & ranking of schools

Seems to be variation of Galeâ€“Shapley algorithm (dealing with stable marriage problem)

However:
* there are ____ HS schools in NYC
* students only rank their top 12 schools 
 
How will we deal with # of schools? 

### Matching algorithm alone:
* Assume N schools, N students
* Need to store:
  * for each school: current match (default == free), ranking of students and whether they've tried to match with the student before
  * for each student: current match (default == free), ranking of schools
  * number of schools that don't have a match (initial = all)

#### Flow:
Set all schools', students' matches to free

```
while free_schools.len() > 0:
  S = free_schools[0]
  T = 1st student on S's list (that S hasn't tried to match with)
  if T.match != free:
    S_prime = T.get_match()
    if T.rank(S) > T.rank(S_prime)
      S_prime.set_match(free)
      T.set_match(S)
      S.set_match(T)
  else:
    T.set_match(S)
    S.set_match(T)
```
